      <h2>House Blend Coffee</h2>
      <img src="Cup.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="" /><br />
      <p>
        House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and
        every drinker. That is what makes them so unique and so special. The
        blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference of the
        roaster and/or distributor. For example, Starbucks describes their House
        Blend as “the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. The
        one blend that set the course for the way our master blenders and
        roasters work even today. A true reflection of us and delicious cup of
        coffee, period.”

      <h2>French Roats</h2>
      <img src="french.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="" />
      <p>
        Simply put, “French roast” describes the color of the coffee beans after
        they have been roasted. These interesting beans are on the darker end of
        the scale, and are usually the color of dark chocolate. It does not mean
        the coffee was grown or roasted in France (although yes, that is where
        the roasting style originated in the 1800s).

      <h2>Columbian Roats</h2>

      <br />
      <p>
        Columbian coffee is coffee that is grown and harvested in Columbia. The
        whole bean coffee might be roasted somewhere else entirely, but
        Colombian coffee beans must be grown in Columbia for the coffee to be
        labeled Columbian coffee. Of algrowing conditions high in the Columbian
        Alps are perfectly suited for brewing excellent coffee. High altitudes
        are essential for growing higher quality beans, and in the Appalachian
        Mountains in Columbia, they are also equipped with volcanic soil, which
        is ideal for coffee farming. Rich in nutrients, as well as minerals, the
        Columbian soil brings out complex flavors in the coffee beans. The soil
        is also very porous, which is ideal for growing coffee, as growers
        prefer that their crops get plenty of water, but require excellent
        drainage as well, as coffee trees will not grow well with wet feet.
