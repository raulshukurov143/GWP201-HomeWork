        Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored,
        bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans,
        primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the
        world market for hot drinks.[3] Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are
        separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted
        and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot
        water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is
        usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee
        can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso,
        French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar,
        sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often used to mask the bitter
        taste or enhance the flavor.
